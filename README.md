# About -
If you don’t track your expenses during the year, you’ll have to look for information and take time to find out what you spent your money on. It will be an additional job that takes up a lot of time; time that could have otherwise been used for other crucial tasks. People usually fail to properly manage their expenses, since they don’t have time nor the means to efficiently keep track of how they spend. If you can track your expenses all the time, you won’t have to immerse yourself in tax reporting. Moreover, when people ignore from constantly planning their finances, they often live in debt or from one salary to another.
Considering the above, we decided that something needs to be done about these issues. If you can track everything in an expense tracker application, it will help you think more about spending money wisely and not ignoring the inflow and outflow of funds.
